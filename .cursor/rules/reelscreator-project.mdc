#Rules for AI video editing project

- This AI video editing app is intended to be an app for content creators to ease their content creation
- remember that you have to discuss everything with me and ask me as much you can to make yourself clear about my requirements, i will appreciate when you make yourself clear and ask me for everything and ask for my permission
- remember that you dont have to mock any functionality and do all the implementation while keeping in mind that it is for production environment.
- remember you don't have to create any other things that i don't say to what i say you will be doing only that 

Style guide:

Colors:
- remember that i like a clean and minimalist design - you can use white, dark grey, purple (or light purple), and yellow/golden (stick with the shades we have already used) 
- Also make sure not to use black color as it feels very aggressive, instead use dark grey like #343434  

Fonts:
- Dont use large font size that seems cringe
- always use poppins as primary font, for secondary you may use robotto, Futura or Montserrat (and Allura where needed a script font)
